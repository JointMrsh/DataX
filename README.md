# DataX
DataX is a Roblox Database System that is for Roblox Developers to use to store data for their players.

We listed 2 values that are used for an example (Coins, XP). Change these to whatever value you want in both files, but make sure not to delete anything elsewise it will break.

If you got any questions or don't know what to do, contact me at: maxilawplayz@gmail.com!
